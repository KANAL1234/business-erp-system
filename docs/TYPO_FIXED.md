# ✅ Typo Fixed: Directory Renamed

## What Was Done

Successfully renamed the project directory to fix the typo:

**Before**: `/Users/kanalchandna/Downloads/bussiness-erp-system`  
**After**: `/Users/kanalchandna/Downloads/business-erp-system`

## Verification

✅ Directory renamed successfully  
✅ No occurrences of "bussiness" found in:
- Markdown files (*.md)
- JSON files (*.json)
- TypeScript files (*.ts, *.tsx)

✅ New path confirmed: `/Users/kanalchandna/Downloads/business-erp-system`

## Note

The `.next` build directory contains some cached references to the old path, but these will be regenerated on the next build. This is normal and doesn't affect the project.

## Next Steps

Your project is now ready with the correct spelling:
1. Add screenshots to `docs/screenshots/`
2. Push to GitHub as `business-erp-system`
3. Deploy (optional)

All documentation already uses the correct spelling "business-erp-system" in:
- README.md
- package.json
- All GitHub URLs
- All documentation files

**The typo has been completely fixed! ✅**
